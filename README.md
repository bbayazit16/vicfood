# vicfood.ca

VicFood displays the food currently served at the University of Toronto, Victoria University's Burwash Dining Hall.

Motivation: As a student at Victoria College, I found it hard to check what food is being served at Burwash Dining Hall. The only way to check the menu was to go on the Victoria College website, click on the Burwash Dining Hall page, and then click on the menu, and then choose the correct week, and then the day, etc. This was a very tedious process, and I wanted to make it easier for myself and other students to check the menu. VicFood automatically displays the menu for the current day, and also allows users to check the menu for other days.
